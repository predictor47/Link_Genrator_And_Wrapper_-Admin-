Overview
The Wrapper Tool is designed to enhance the integrity and reliability of survey responses by implementing a comprehensive tracking and validation system. This document outlines the key features, requirements, and functionalities of the tool, providing developers with a clear understanding of its purpose and implementation.
Key Features
* Mass Wrapped Link Generator:
The tool will allow users to generate multiple wrapped survey links in bulk, facilitating easy distribution while maintaining tracking capabilities.
* CAPTCHA Implementation:
To prevent automated submissions, the tool will integrate CAPTCHA challenges that respondents must complete before submitting their responses. This ensures that only human participants can access the survey.
* Cursor Timing Tracking:
The tool will track cursor movements and timings throughout the survey to analyze user engagement and identify potential bot-like behavior.
* IP Address Tracking:
Each response will capture the respondent's IP address to determine geographical location and detect potential use of VPNs.
* Device Information:
The tool will log the type of device (mobile, tablet, desktop) and operating system used by respondents, allowing for analysis of response patterns across different platforms.
* Browser Details:
Information about the browser type and version will be recorded to ensure compatibility and identify any anomalies in response behavior.
* Timestamps:
The exact time each response is submitted will be logged to detect rapid submissions or responses at unusual hours.
* Response Time Measurement:
The tool will measure the time taken to complete the survey, helping to identify unusually quick responses that may indicate automated submissions.
* Copy/Pasting Detection:
Mechanisms will be implemented to detect instances of copy/pasting in responses, flagging potential non-authentic submissions.
* Trap Questions:
The tool will include trap questions that require specific knowledge or attention, filtering out inattentive or non-expert respondents.
* VPN or Location Detection:
The tool will analyze IP addresses to identify potential VPN usage and validate the geographical location of respondents.
* Start/Finish Time Tracking:
The tool will track the time taken from the initial landing page (Survey) to the final survey submission (PR landing page), providing insights into user engagement.
* Batch Pasting Detection:
The tool will monitor for batch pasting behavior, identifying instances where respondents may be submitting multiple responses in quick succession.
Implementation Requirements
Technical Specifications
   * Programming Language: The tool should be developed using a suitable programming language (e.g., ) that supports web-based applications.
   * Database: A robust database (e.g.) will be required to store response data, metadata, and tracking information securely.
   * Frontend Framework: Consider using a frontend framework (e.g.,) to create a user-friendly interface for survey distribution and response collection.
   * Backend Framework: A backend framework (e.g., ) will be necessary to handle data processing, validation, and storage.
Security and Compliance
   * Ensure that all data collection complies with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
   * Implement secure data transmission protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect respondent information.
   * Obtain informed consent from respondents regarding data usage and tracking.
Testing and Validation
   * Conduct thorough testing of all features to ensure functionality and reliability.
   * Implement user testing to gather feedback on the tool's usability and effectiveness in tracking and validating responses.
Conclusion
The Wrapper Tool is a comprehensive solution for tracking and validating survey responses, ensuring data integrity and authenticity. By implementing the features outlined in this document, developers can create a robust tool that enhances the quality of survey data while addressing concerns related to bots, VPN usage, and non-expert respondents.
