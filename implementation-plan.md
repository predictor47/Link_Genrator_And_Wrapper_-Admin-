# AWS Amplify Migration Implementation Plan

## Completed Steps
- [x] Updated package.json to remove Prisma dependencies
- [x] Converted API endpoints to use Amplify services instead of Prisma
- [x] Updated frontend pages to use Amplify data services

## Remaining Steps

### 1. Remove Prisma-Related Files
Delete the following files and directories as they're no longer needed:
- `src/lib/prisma.ts`
- `prisma/` directory and all its contents
- Any Prisma references in deployment directories

### 2. Update Any Remaining API Endpoints
Ensure all API endpoints use `amplifyDataService` instead of `prisma`:
- Check for any remaining imports of `prisma` in the codebase
- Replace all Prisma query operations with equivalent Amplify operations

### 3. Finalize Amplify Backend Setup
- Run `npm run setup-amplify` to generate and configure Amplify backend definitions
- Run `npx ampx pipeline-deploy --yes` to deploy backend resources before building the frontend
- Verify that all required environment variables are set in the Amplify console

### 4. Testing
- Test all API endpoints to ensure they work with Amplify
- Test frontend pages to ensure data is properly retrieved and displayed
- Verify authentication flows work correctly

### 5. Deployment
- Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the Amplify backend and frontend
- Verify the deployed application works as expected

## Files Updated to Use Amplify Instead of Prisma
- API endpoints:
  - `src/pages/api/vendors/list.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/vendors/delete.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/vendors/create.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/projects/[id]/questions.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/projects/delete.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/links/update-status.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/links/flag.ts`
  - `src/pages/api/links/complete.ts`
  
- Frontend pages:
  - `src/pages/admin/index.tsx`
  - `src/pages/admin/projects/[id].tsx`
  - `src/pages/completion/[projectId]/[uid].tsx`
  - `src/pages/s/[projectId]/[uid].tsx`
  - `src/pages/survey/[projectId]/[uid].tsx`

## Benefits of Migrating to AWS Amplify
- Simplified infrastructure (single provider)
- Better scalability with DynamoDB
- Integrated authentication with Cognito
- Streamlined deployment process
- Improved security with AWS IAM
